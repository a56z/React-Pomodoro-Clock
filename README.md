# React-Pomodoro-Clock

/** NOTES:
/** Dependencies are React, ReactDOM, and 
    Accurate_Interval.js by Squuege (external script 
    to keep setInterval() from drifting over time & 
    thus ensuring timer goes off at correct mark).
/** Utilizes embedded <Audio> tag to ensure audio 
    plays when timer tab is inactive or browser is 
    minimized ( rather than new Audio().play() ).
/** Audio of this fashion not supported on most 
    mobile devices it would seem (bummer I know).
